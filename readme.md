# NewFileHere

A simple macOS app that lets you create a new file in the current directory.
Wraps a script from here: https://gist.github.com/rarylson/5d20fc96335851365a02

This largely isn't my work, but I figured having the wrapper around it would be convenient for some.

# Installation

* Run `sh ./compile.sh`. This generates `NewFileHere.app`
* Hold Command and drag the app into your Finder toolbar.
* Give the app accessibility permissions, or you'll get a "not allowed to send keystrokes" error when you run it.
* Click the app to create a new file in the current directory.
